#demo site login page
demo.welcome=WELCOME TO RURALINVEST
demo.version=VERSION
demo.para1=The RuralInvest demonstration site has been created to provide those who are interested in the software portion of RuralInvest to see what it looks like and how it functions.
demo.para2=To enter the programme, type <b>Visitor</b> for both <b>User Name</b> and <b>Password</b>. If you plan to create any cases of your own (see below) you may wish to create your own user name and password. To do this go to the Configuration Tab and select "Users". Choose the option "Add User" and fill in the details. <b>Note:</b> Do not forget your User Name or Password, as we have no copy.
demo.para3=In order to make the experience more useful, we have provided some example cases in each of the main categories covered by RuralInvest software: 
demo.profile=A <b>PROFILE</b> is a simplified version of a project, using a single year of activity for a project in full operation, and does not include such aspects as financing. Profiles are intended to be prepared together with the applicant(s) - usually on paper - and only transferred to the computer afterwards. Because of its simplified nature,  a positive profile does not guarantee that the full project analysis will be positive as well, but a profile will identify ideas which are clearly not feasible, and allows the applicants to define and understand the major elements of the project.
demo.project=A <b>PROJECT</b>, by contrast, must be prepared on the computer, as it includes many automated routines for elements such as working capital needs, employment generation, the impact of non-cash costs and income, financing, etc. A full project analysis may not be necessary or worthwhile where a proposed investment is below a few thousand dollars, but it provides much more information than a profile and takes account of changes over time. Financing of projects can be through grants, loans or a mix of the two.
demo.guide=If you have not had much contact with RuralInvest before, you may find it useful to have the <b>SOFTWARE USER GUIDE</b> at hand. It can be found by selecting the Help Tab, and then "User Manuals". <b>Note:</b> The guide is in Powerpoint and is approximately 100 pages, but can be printed in multiple slides per page. This section also offers <b>TECHNICAL MANUALS</b> (Modules 1 to 3), explaining the underlying basis for the analysis undertaken.
demo.examples.1=Start your visit by looking at the <b>EXAMPLE CASES</b> available. These are accessible by selecting the Show Completed option under each category, and then clicking on the Edit icon
demo.examples.2=to the right of any file name. <b>Note:</b> Other visitors may have created other cases, but all example cases will start with the phrase "Example Case". Example cases can be viewed but not modified by visitors.
demo.create=If you want to try creating a case of your own, select Create New under any category and start filling in the required information. The computer will not let you advance to the next sheet until the current one is filled in. <b>Note:</b> The RuralInvest demonstration site is wiped clean on the last day of every month, so any  cases you create will disappear at that time. If you wish to make a copy of the report resulting from your case (or the examples), go to the Summary and Reports sheet within any case, and select the type of report desired. <b>Note:</b> Reports can only be generated for completed cases.

faq.1.a=This software tool forms part of a "toolkit" comprising manuals, training materials and computer software, that together provide a basis for a relatively simple, yet reliable, approach to the identification, formulation, implementation and evaluation of small-scale community or family investment projects in rural areas. RuralInvest tools are best used for small and medium scale projects that run from perhaps US$5,000 to somewhere not greatly exceeding US$250,000, always depending greatly on the complexity of the project design.
faq.1.q=Is RuralInvest only software analytical tool? 
faq.2.a=The project profile is the starting point for both income generating and non-income generating projects. Micro-investments (very simple projects with an investment below US$5,000) often may not require further preparation beyond this stage, as financing can be decided on the basis of the 4-page profile. The profiles provide enough information about the investment to allow both the applicant(s) and the eventual financing source to see which ideas have potential, and are thus worth the further effort and resources required to develop them in detail.
faq.2.q=What is a project profile?
faq.3.a=The depth and level of detail required in the process of formulation and evaluation will depend on the complexity and the scope of the project. The technical analyst will provide support to the applicants and to the local technician in some or all of the following tasks: determination of demand and benefits; evaluation of the proposals technical feasibility and scale; sustainability, both in financial and in environmental terms; determination of the detailed costs of the investment and its subsequent operation; selection and specification of an appropriate management and administrative structure; and estimation of sources and costs of financing. The process of formulation and evaluation requires the use of a computer It is essential that contact be maintained between the responsible technician and the applicant(s) to insure that the proposal truly reflects their needs. Furthermore, it may be that the detailed formulation reveals aspects of the investment that require the applicants to reconsider their plans (for example, competition for labour at key periods of the year, or high maintenance costs).
faq.3.q=What is a detailed project?
faq.4.a=The category of income-generating projects covers a wide range of possible activities: agricultural production, aquaculture, rural shops, irrigation, agro-industry, handicrafts, tourism, transport, the fabrication of simple machinery and spare parts, and marketing services. A project may, in fact, require investment in more than one of these areas, and will frequently involve more than one type of productive activity from the same investment (e.g. production of different crops as a result of investment in irrigation)
faq.4.q=What is an income-generating project?
faq.5.a=The category of non-income generating projects also includes a broad range of activities and can be divided into three distinct sub-groups: (1) production support, including access roads and bridges, electrification and communications, as well as primary irrigation infrastructure; (2) social projects such as health and education services, provision of drinking water and sewage disposal, and support for community organization; and (3) environmental projects such as watershed and slope protection, reforestation and soil conservation.
faq.5.q=What is a non-income generating project?
faq.6.a=The investment is the heart of any project. In fact a project can be defined as an activity in which an investment is made now in order to obtain a benefit in the future. An investment is a kind of expense, but it can be distinguished by the duration of its impact. If it lasts no more than a year, it cannot be considered as an investment and must instead be treated as an operating cost.
faq.6.q=What is an investment cost?
faq.7.a=Investments are not the only costs that a project faces. Once the project is under way, there are costs that must be met annually (or more frequently). Costs that are not investments are described as recurring costs; that is, they occur year after year. This concept deals with two distinct categories: production costs and general expenses.
