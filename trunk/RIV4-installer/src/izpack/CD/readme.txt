Just launch setup.exe and if needed the installer asks you to provide Administrator login to continue.
If you fail to do this the installation may continue, but it will not work, and you'll have some error
messages.
On some installation of Vista/7, Windows may show you a windows saying the installer may not
finished correctly, prompting to choose between some options. Unless you noticed any errors during
the installation procedure, it's an error belonging to Windows, not a real issue.
Feel free to select the option that the installer ended correctly.
The installer add a service named "RuralInvest", so the application will be available at any boot.
