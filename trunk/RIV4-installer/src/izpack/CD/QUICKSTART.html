		<h1>RuralInvest Quick-Start</h1>
		<h2>Which version to install</h2>
		<p>Before proceeding it is important to install the correct version of 
			<b>RuralInvest</b>. There are 2 versions:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b><i><u>Administrator</i></u></b>:<br/> 
				This version is intended for the administrator of a collection of RuralInvest installations. The full configuration of the system may be modified including the Language, Field Offices, Categories, Beneficiaries, Settings (Discount rate, Maximum project duration, Currency, Exchange rate, Locations, Loan parameters, Quick links etc.). 
				<br/><br/>
				<b>NOTE:</b> This version should NOT be generally available<br/><br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b><i><u>User</i></u></b>:<br/>
				This version is intended for end users. With the exception of defining new users, the configuration of the system may NOT be modified. The configuration of the installation is accomplished by importing predefined settings provided by an administrator. To download the installer ask your FAO referrer.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>NOTE:</b> This version can be freely distributed
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Both versions support exporting and importing configuration settings which are fully interchangeable and compatible.
			<br/><br/>
			Directly after installation both versions will be slightly slower than may be expected. After a period of initial use (once each page has been visited) the installation will reach optimal performance.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Using the <i>Administrator</i> version for the first time</h2>
		<p>During the installation you will be prompted to choose a username and a password, you can then login to the application.</p>
		<p><b>NOTE:</b> Remember your username and password, as there are no way to recover your password.  If you forget your password you will need to reinstall.</p>
		<p>On completion you will be prompted to log in as the newly created user. Once you have entered the system as the newly created user you will be prompted to complete the configuration for the installation. </p>
		<p>For the administrator version, the configuration can be either set manually or imported from a settings file.
		[See <b><u><a href="img/riv_import_settings.gif">riv_import_settings.gif</a></b></u>]
		</p>
		<p>As an administrator you can share the configuration settings for use in user installations using Configuration-&gt;Settings-&gt;Export 
			[See <b><u><a href="img/riv_export_settings.gif">riv_export_settings.gif</a></b></u>]
		</p>
		
		<h2>Using the <i>User</i> version for the first time</h2>
		<p>During the installation you will be prompted to choose a username and a password, you can then login to the application.</p>
		<p><b>NOTE:</b> Remember your username and password, as there are no way to recover your password.  If you forget your password you will need to reinstall.</p>
		
		<h2>Example settings</h2>
		<p>On completion you will be prompted to log in as the newly created user. Once you have entered the system as the newly created user you will be prompted to import the system configuration data.
