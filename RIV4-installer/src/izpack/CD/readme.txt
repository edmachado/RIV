1. Introduction

The installation of RuralInvest requires root/administrator privileges.
If you've not granted rights to administer your machine, please ask the Administrator to run
the installer. Please, do not login as root/administrator, but just run installer with root/administator
privileges. Follow instruction based on your running OS.  


2.1 Installing on Windows
---------------------
Just launch setup.exe and if needed the installer asks you to provide Administrator login to continue.
If you fail to do this the installation may continue, but it will not work, and you'll have some error
messages.

On some installation of Vista/7, Windows may show you a windows saying the installer may not
finished correctly, prompting to choose between some options. Unless you noticed any errors during
the installation procedure, it's an error belonging to Windows, not a real issue.
Feel free to select the option that the installer ended correctly.
The installer add a service named "RuralInvest", so the application will be available at any boot.

2.2 Installing on MacOS
-----------------------
We hope to have a MacOS installer ready soon.
